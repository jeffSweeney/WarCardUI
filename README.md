# WarCardUI
Simple game of War app

This was my very first completed app. There's nothing advanced going on here. It was an exercise in applying the
early SwiftUI skills I had learned regarding state properties, buttons, etc.

In terms of gameplay, there is only 13 cards (one per rank). I also haven't implemented the draw scenario.

// TODO - Implement a full 52 card deck and draw case.
